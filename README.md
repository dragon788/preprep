# preprep

Prep's vanilla Ubuntu to not suck and gets the system ready for development.

Primarily and originally for making my laptop install portable in case it gets nuked.

developed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

designed with developers in mind:
* options to Mac-ify system gui experience
* runs completely from terminal
* cli gui prevents mistakes
* scripts have practical and functional examples making extending preprep a breeze
